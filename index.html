      <p class="output">
        As a logical-minded person who is creative, I love challenges and I’m
        always eager to learn new things and find solutions. Immediately after
        my graduation, I started learning programming on my own. I had been
        programmer for more than 4 years. Studying in this branch of knowledge
        never ends and it’s good for me. Nowadays I'm trying to make progress
        and I truly like to work as a member of a professional and expert team.
        I look forward to participating in challenging projects.
